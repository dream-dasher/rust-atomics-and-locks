# Scratch Repo to accompany [Rust Atomics and Locks](https://marabos.nl/atomics/basics.html)

### **note**: 
The physical copy I'm using is written for **Stable Rust v`1.66.0`** (Dec. 2022).  
This repo, as of start, is using **Nightly Rust v`1.86.0-nightly`** (Feb. 2023).
I am uncertain whether the online version is updated relative to the physical copy, but am using both.
